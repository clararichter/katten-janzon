The mandelbrot set is the set of values c = a + bi in the complex plane for which the sequence of complex numbers given with the formula Zn+1 = Zn^2 + c and the start value Z0 = 0 does not diverge to infinity.

Absolute value of a complex number?

Unfortunately, it's not possible to perform an infinite number of iterations in a finite amount of time.

The following fact is used:
If the absolute value of any Zn is greater than 2, then the sequence diverges to infinity.

A maximum number of iterations is decided upon and for a specific c, if |Zn| exceeds 2 before reaching the max iteration, it is assumed that c belongs to the Mandelbrot set.
